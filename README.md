# Loan Agreement Project
Welcome to the Loan Agreement Project! This project revolves around utilizing machine learning, particularly the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 
algorithm, to predict whether loan applications should be approved or not based on historical data. If you're interested in the field of 
finance and data-driven decision-making, this project offers valuable insights into loan approval processes.

## Overview
In this project, we focus on predicting the approval status of loan applications using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. By leveraging 
historical data and features related to borrowers' financial and personal attributes, we aim to build a predictive model that assists lenders 
in making informed decisions regarding loan approvals.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project was sourced from Kaggle and contains a comprehensive collection of loan application records. It encompasses a 
range of attributes such as income, credit score, employment status, and more. The dataset forms the foundation for training and evaluating 
our KNN-based prediction model.
For data privacy and integrity reasons, we are unable to include the dataset in this repository. You can download it from the following Kaggle 
link: [Loan Application Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/dataset_link_here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/architsharma01/loan-approval-prediction-dataset))
